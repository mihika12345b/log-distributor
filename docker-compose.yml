# Docker Compose configuration for Logs Distributor demo
#
# This sets up:
# - 1 distributor service (port 8000)
# - 4 analyzer services (ports 8001-8004) with different weights
#
# Network: All services are on the same network so they can communicate
# by service name (e.g., http://analyzer-1:8001)

services:
